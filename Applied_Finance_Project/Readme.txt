We test different algorithms in machine learning to figure out what is the most important factors to predict consumer defaulting probability in motorcycle leasing industry. The structure and code file are described as following:

1. Clean_data.ipynb: read raw data and seperate data by certain criterias to tell the status of the loans, then seperating data into training data and test data. 
2. LR_all_features.ipynb: use logistic regression on all variables availble. Then we try to reduce feature size by 50 and see what is the outcome in training data and test data.
3. SMOTE and RF.ipynb: use SMOTE in unbalance data and prove that the result after SMOTE is better than using original data.
